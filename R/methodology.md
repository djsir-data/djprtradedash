# Global Victoria Trade Dashboard Data Methodology

## Introduction

The **Global Victoria Trade Dashboard** includes detailed export and import data compiled and released by the *Australian Bureau of Statistics*, the *Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade* (DFAT) and the *Australian Border Force*. References and citations under respective charts will specify the time period of the data (i.e. whether it is produced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis), as well as whether it is original (raw) data, seasonally adjusted, and/or revised. State level trade data is reflecting the exports/imports of businesses located within a particular state and not the value of goods that arrive at ports located within the state of interest.

## Balance of Payments Data

Balance of Payments (BoP) data contains comprehensive estimates of Victoria's total exports (broken down by goods and services) on a quarterly basis in seasonally adjusted terms. The export data corresponds with [Table 21 - Goods and services credits by state on a balance of payments basis - quarter](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/balance-payments-and-international-investment-position-australia/latest-release), while the import data corresponds with [Table 22 – Goods and services debits by state on a balance of payments basis – quarter](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/balance-payments-and-international-investment-position-australia/latest-release#data-download). The BoP summarises transactions between residents and non-residents during a specific time period.  

Quarterly BoP statistics are subject to large, short-term movements which make the interpretation of trends in the original series difficult. Seasonally adjusted estimates are derived by estimating and removing systematic calendar related effects from the original series. These include seasonal (e.g. Christmas), trading day and moving holiday (e.g. Easter) influences. Seasonal adjustment does not aim to remove the irregular or non-seasonal influences which may be present in any particular quarter. These irregular influences may reflect both random economic events and difficulties of statistical recording. 

Though efforts are made to align monthly and quarterly data, monthly seasonally adjusted estimates released in [International Trade in Goods and Services, Australia](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/international-trade-goods-and-services-australia/latest-release) (cat. no. 5368.0) may not align with the quarterly estimates released in this publication due to different compilation procedures necessary for monthly and quarterly data. 

The conceptual framework used in compiling Victoria's balance of payment statistics is based on the International Monetary Fund's [Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm) (BPM6).  

The BoP data in this dashboard covers the current account (not the capital account or financial account), which measures exports and imports of goods and services. In many cases in this dashboard as well, Chain Volume Measures of balance of payment data are used. Chain volume data shows changes in volume over time, with prices held constant. It should be interpreted as the value of trade in any particular year when measured in the year prior to the latest complete financial year prices, not the $ value of trade recorded in that year. For further information on chain volume measures refer to Page 5 the ABS publication: Information paper, Australian National Accounts, Introduction of Chain Volume and Price Indexes ([Catalogue 5248.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5248.0Main+Features1Sep%201997?OpenDocument)).

The balance on current account is derived by aggregating all relevant transactions (i.e. trade in goods, trade in services, primary income and secondary income). A balance is said to be in surplus if credit entries exceed debit entries or in deficit if debit entries exceed credit entries.  

A summary of Australia's BoP can be found in table 1 of [Balance of Payments and International Investment Position, Australia](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/balance-payments-and-international-investment-position-australia/latest-release#data-download) (cat. no. 5302.0). 

## Merchandise Exports Data

The estimates of international trade in goods and services on a balance of payments basis are seasonally adjusted, however the merchandise exports and imports statistics on an international merchandise trade basis are not. Monthly original estimates are volatile, being subject to calendar-related and large irregular influences. Monthly merchandise exports presented in this dashboard can be displayed in both 'Original' and 12-month averages. A 12-month average is the total amount from the past 12 months divided by the number of periods (12). As the 12-month period "rolls" forward each month, the amount from the latest month is added and the one-year-old amount is subtracted. The result is a 12-month average that includes the newest month's data.  

The dashboard shows nominal figures for value of the commodity. The historical value of the imports and exports has not been adjusted for inflation to make it directly comparable between years. 
 
Goods credits (export) data are based on information provided by exporters to the Department of Home Affairs. At the time of initial reporting to Home Affairs, the final prices at which transactions take place are not known for some commodities. Final quantity and/or unit price information is updated progressively in international merchandise trade data as exporters revise the information provided to Home Affairs. 

For commodities such as iron ore and coal, newly negotiated contract prices are not fully reflected in data first reported to Home Affairs. When additional information on quantity and/or unit price for these commodities is available, the ABS may adjust the data to reflect actual transaction values. 

A summary of revisions made to Victoria's goods exports can be found within the 'Supplementary Information' tab [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/international-trade-goods-and-services-australia/latest-release#supplementary-information).  
While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of estimates, most series are subject to revision as more complete and accurate information becomes available. Care should be exercised in the use and interpretation of monthly merchandise data. The revisions are applied differently for merchandise trade and balance of payments series. Each month, merchandise trade data are revised for the previous six months to incorporate latest available data. 

### Confidential Items of Trade

The ABS makes some data confidential. Further information can be found in the [Confidential Commodities List](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/international-merchandise-trade-confidential-commodities-list/latest-release#data-download). Where necessary, a ‘restriction’ is placed, at the commodity level, to suppress the level of detail available. Depending on the nature of the restriction, this may be all detail relating to the product (no commodity details), or a suppression of only some variables (e.g. selected country details). Changes in confidentiality restrictions over time may affect the time series. See the [International Merchandise Trade, Australia: Concepts, Sources and Methods, 2018](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5489.0) for more details.

### SITC Classification

Merchandise trade data are reported on an international merchandise trade basis, using the Standard International Trade Classification Revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4) commodity classification, abbreviated as SITC.  

SITC, Rev. 4 was accepted by the United Nations Statistical Commission at its thirty-seventh session (March 2006). The Interagency Task Force on International Merchandise Trade Statistics recommends SITC, Rev. 4 for use in the analysis of international merchandise trade by interested countries and international organizations. 

The groupings of SITC reflect: 

- the production materials;  
- the processing stage; 
- market practices and uses of the products; 
- the importance of the goods in world trade; and/or
- technological changes. 

The main categories are:

- *food, drinks and tobacco* (Sections 0 and 1 - including live animals);  
- *raw materials* (Sections 2 and 4); 
- *energy products* (Section 3); 
- *chemicals* (Section 5); 
- *machinery and transport equipment* (Section 7); 
- *other manufactured goods* (Sections 6 and 8).
